I am Raja Biswas, currently working as a Research Fellow in National University of Singapore (NUS).  I would like to describe myself as a creative, self-motivated and detail oriented research scholar with extensive experience in developing robust predictive models using novel algorithms, scientific computing and data processing.


I have a background in Engineering, with my bachelorâ€™s degree from IIT Kanpur, one of the best technical institute in India. Driven by my interest to solve challenging problems using state-of-the-art research tools, I followed up my bachelor studies with a PhD degree in Computational Mechanics. As a part of my PhD project, I developed a novel computational homogenization algorithm to predict the response of heterogeneous systems, which addressed the limitations of the standard homogenization method and existing higher-order techniques. My research work was published in top peer reviewed journals in the domain of applied mechanics and won best student paper award in EMI 2017 conference.


During my graduate studies, I started developing a keen interest towards data science, as I understood how deep learning algorithms can be applied in many high-impact projects, both in academia and industry. My transition to data science started with successfully completing the deep learning specialization (by deeplearning.ai) in Coursera. Many transferable skills from my graduate studies e.g. coding in Python, strong background in Linear algebra and research knowledge made it easier for me to learn the relevant details quickly when necessary. For example, I recently participated in a data science competition organized by Shopee SG, where the objective was to build a machine learning model for product category classification in the eCommerce domain. The competition was an enriching experience for me with a steep learning curve. Despite the short duration, we were able to implement several NLP and CNN algorithms and ensemble the predictions to secure third position in the leaderboard out of 360 teams. In addition, I am actively involved in Kaggle completions and personal data science projects, where I focus on leveraging state-of-the-art NLP algorithms such as the Transformer and ElMo for improving model predictions.


In my current position as Research Fellow, I use deep learning on day to day basis to predict homogenized response of a given microstructure, which requires sequential modelling due to the inherent history dependent nature of the underlying components. I have been able to develop a proof-of-concept predictive model using LSTM with potential applications in material science research.


I am looking for job opportunities, where I can add value to the data science team in industry driven projects by applying my skill set in NLP and computer vision. Please feel free to get in touch with me directly at ceerb@nus.edu.sg. I look forward to connecting with you!

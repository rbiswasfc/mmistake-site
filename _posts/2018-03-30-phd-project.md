## Introduction
Write about the aneed and applications of coputational homogenization

## First-order computational homogenization
Discuss the strategy

## Micromorphic computational homogenization
I have developed a novel comutational mechanics framework that translate the underlying micro-scale responses to the macro scale

## Algorithm
Show the nested solution scheme

## Numerical examples
show some illustrative examples

## References
linke to the JMPS paper
